Hackers, Security issues, and exploits all exists, because the software
we use isn't perfect. It's written by humans. One or two edge cases from the best
programmers might slip through. This doesn't mean just software,
but languages, and even hardware.\\

\noindent
The languages we use are just solutions we thought would work. Binary is a solution, it's not the intrinsic solution,
but it's a solution. So we built assembly on top, then C, Java, and so on abstracting the
difficult parts. But the more we abstract, the more we lose control. A vulnerability
can quickly cascade up a chain of abstractions.\\
