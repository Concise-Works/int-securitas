Hackers, Security issues, and exploits all exists, because the software
we use isn't perfect. It's written by another human, and even the best of us
don't account for every possible scenario. This doesn't mean just software,
but languages, protocols, and even hardware.\\

The languages we use are solutions, we thought would work, but they are only as
good as the people who wrote them. Binary is a solution, it's not the intrinsic solution,
it's just the one we use. So we built assembly, and then we built C, and so on abstracting the
difficult parts. But the more we abstract, the more we lose control, and the more
cracks appear.\\
